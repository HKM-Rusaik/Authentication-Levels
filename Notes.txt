encryption => The process of coverting information or data into a code, especially to prevent unauthorized access.

Caesar Cipher => Encryption method Invented by Julius caesar => substitute the word to numbers or alphabet.
Password + key -caesarcipher----> ciphertext

Symmetric encryption  ->  encryption and decryption key same

Hashing -> using Hashing function, turn the password into hash (encryption).  Impossible to go backwards.
So when login password, it gets the hash then it compares with existing hash  in database. If they match, allow access.

plaintextoffenders  ---> checking the website security

salting -> addding additional random set of characters for password to put into hash.

20,000,000,000 MD5 hashes/second
17,000 bcrypt Hashes/second

bcrypt uses -> Blowfish cipher algorithm
